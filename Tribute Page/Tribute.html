<h2>A brief summary of Gandhi's journey</h2>
<h3>Early life</h3>
<p>
Mohandas Karamchand Gandh was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj.
Although young Gandhi wanted to become a doctor, his father, who served as a chief minister in Porbandar, persuaded him to study law.
After 3 years of studies in London (where he became a vegetarian), Gandhi came back to India and tried to start his career as a lawyer.
His attempts at establishing a law practice in Bombay failed because he was psychologically unable to cross-examine witnesses.
</p>
<h3>South Africa</h3>
<p>
After struggling to find a job in India, he went to South Africa for a one-year contract to perform legal services. 
Gandhi was there confronted with discrimination against Indian immigrants by British authorities. 
At the end of his contract, Gandhi fought against a bill that would ban Indians from voting. 
Although he didn't stop the bill from passing, it initiated his fight for equality of human rights.
</p>
<h3>Return to India</h3>
<p>
In 1915, Gandhi sailed from South Africa to India, where he founded an ashram that was open to all castes.
He brought an international reputation as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and community organiser.

<h3>Struggle for Indian independence</h3>
<p>
Gandhi joined the Indian National Congress and was introduced to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily by Gokhale. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party best known for his restraint and moderation, and his insistence on working inside the system. Gandhi took Gokhale's liberal approach based on British Whiggish traditions and transformed it to make it look Indian.
Gandhi took leadership of the Congress in 1920 and began escalating demands until on 26 January 1930 the Indian National Congress declared the independence of India. The British did not recognise the declaration but negotiations ensued, with the Congress taking a role in provincial government in the late 1930s. Gandhi and the Congress withdrew their support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in September 1939 without consultation. Tensions escalated until Gandhi demanded immediate independence in 1942 and the British responded by imprisoning him and tens of thousands of Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the Muslim League did co-operate with Britain and moved, against Gandhi's strong opposition, to demands for a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan. In August 1947 the British partitioned the land with India and Pakistan each achieving independence on terms that Gandhi disapproved.
</p>
<h3>Assasination</h3>
<p>
Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu nationalist, Nathuram Godse, in Delhi on January 30, 1948.
Godse stated that he killed Gandhi because of his complacency towards Muslims, holding him responsible for the frenzy of violence and suffering.
Gandhi's death was mourned nationwide, and over a million people joined the five-mile-long funeral procession that took over five hours. 
</p>
<h3>Legacy</h3>
<p>
Gandhi's commitment to nonviolence and his belief in simple living — making his clothes, eating a vegetarian diet — has been a beacon of hope for oppressed people around the world for decades to come after his death.
Gandhi's actions inspired future human rights movements around the globe, including those of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in the United States and Nelson Mandela in South Africa.
